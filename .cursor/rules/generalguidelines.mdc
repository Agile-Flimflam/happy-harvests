### Senior posture

- Act as a senior engineer: reason before coding, spot risks early, and favor small, reviewable diffs.
- Communicate intent and tradeoffs; document non-obvious choices with concise comments only where needed.

### UI/UX defaults

- UI: You are a senior level frontend developer and UX expert. Always use shadcn. Always style using Tailwind. Always consider mobile-first options.
- Aim for accessibility (labels, aria, focus, contrast) and avoid disruptive UX; prefer progressive enhancement.

### TypeScript rigor

- Never use `any`; prefer explicit types and narrow the shapes you pass around.
- Handle null/undefined explicitly; avoid optional chaining that hides errors.
- Keep async code safe: catch/handle errors, avoid fire-and-forget unless documented, and keep server/client boundaries clear.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` (or project equivalents) before delivery; do not ignore type errors.

### Data-layer boundaries

- Code must never make database queries in API routes or frontend files.
- Route all data access through server actions/services with validation and error handling; prefer typed data adapters to isolate persistence.

### Delivery checklist

- Verify lint/type/tests (or state why skipped); highlight remaining risks/testing gaps.
- Provide concise change notes and call out any behavioral impacts or migration needs.
